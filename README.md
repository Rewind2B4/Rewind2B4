- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rewind2B4

- 👀 I’m interested in automation, all things raspberry Pi, a bit of arduino (but I'm not the best at it....), heaps of python, and will probably end up learning PLC code. 
I have also briefly looked at C++

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, and anything else that will work for my projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation, computer vision, etc.
